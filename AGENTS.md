# Maintenance lessons

- External-registry fixtures must satisfy the complete `ManifestSchema`, including the required `optional.capabilities` and adapter range when depended on, before exercising another validation failure.
- Failed-install rollback tests must explicitly assert the unfinished-operation marker, then compare the other restored files; the marker intentionally survives because `node_modules` is not restored.
- Validation worktree dependency links must remap workspace source directories only, never local `node_modules` directories (otherwise `.bin/vitest` can link to itself).
- For files shared with a background agent, reread the exact current block before editing. Every replacement must be unique; merge overlapping edits and omit speculative/nonexistent matches.
